# Ripser

Copyright © 2015–2016 [Ulrich Bauer].


### Description

Ripser is a lean C++ code for the computation of Vietoris–Rips persistence barcodes. It can do just this one thing, but does it extremely well.

To see a live demo of Ripser's capabilities, go to [live.ripser.org]. The computation happens inside the browser (using [PNaCl] on Chrome and JavaScript via [Emscripten] on other browsers).

The main features of Ripser:

  - time- and memory-efficient
  - less than 1000 lines of code in a single C++ file
  - support for coefficients in prime finite fields
  - no external dependencies (optional support for Google's [sparsehash])

Currently, Ripser outperforms other codes ([Dionysus], [DIPHA], [GUDHI], [Perseus], [PHAT]) by a factor of more than 40 in computation time and a factor of more than 15 in memory efficiency (for the example linked at [live.ripser.org]). (Note that [PHAT] does not contain code for generating Vietoris–Rips filtrations).

Input formats currently supported by Ripser:

  - comma-separated values lower triangular distance matrix (preferred)
  - comma-separated values upper triangular distance matrix (MATLAB output from the function `pdist`)
  - comma-separated values full distance matrix
  - [DIPHA] distance matrix data
  - point cloud data

Ripser's efficiency is based on a few important concepts and principles:
  
  - Compute persistent *co*homology
  - Don't compute information that is never needed
    (for the experts: employ the *clearing* optimization, aka *persistence with a twist*)
  - Don't store information that can be readily recomputed
  - Take obvious shortcuts (*apparent persistence pairs*)


### Version
[Latest release][latest-release]: 1.0.1 (September 2016)


### Building

Ripser requires a C++11 compiler. Here is how to obtain, build, and run Ripser:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ripser/ripser.git
cd ripser
make
./ripser examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix
```


### Options

Ripser supports several compile-time options. They are switched on by defining the C preprocessor macros listed below, either using `#define` in the code or by passing an argument to the compiler. The following options are supported:

  - `ASSEMBLE_REDUCTION_MATRIX`: store the reduction matrix; may affect computation time but also memory usage; recommended for large and difficult problem instances
  - `USE_COEFFICIENTS`: enable support for coefficients in a prime field
  - `INDICATE_PROGRESS`: indicate the current progress in the console
  - `PRINT_PERSISTENCE_PAIRS`: output the computed persistence pairs (enabled by default in the code; comment out to disable)
  - `USE_GOOGLE_HASHMAP`: enable support for Google's [sparsehash] data structure; may further reduce memory footprint

For example, to build Ripser with support for coefficients:

```sh
$ c++ -std=c++11 ripser.cpp -o ripser -Ofast -D NDEBUG -D USE_COEFFICIENTS
```

A Makefile is provided with some variants of the above options. Use `make all` to build them. The default `make` builds a binary with the default options.

The input is given either in a file whose name is passed as an argument, or through stdin. The following options are supported at the command line:

  - `--format`: use the specified file format for the input.  The following formats are supported:
    - `lower-distance` (default if no format is specified): lower triangular distance matrix; a comma (or whitespace, or other non-numerical character) separated list of the distance matrix entries below the diagonal, sorted lexicographically by row index, then column index
    - `upper-distance`: upper triangular distance matrix; similar to the previous, but for the entries above the diagonal; suitable for output from the MATLAB functions `pdist` or  `seqpdist`, exported to a CSV file
    - `distances`: full distance matrix; similar to the above, but for all entries of the distance matrix
    - `dipha`: DIPHA distance matrix as described on the [DIPHA] website
    - `point-cloud`: point cloud; a comma (or whitespace, or other non-numerical character)  separated list of coordinates of the points in some Euclidean space, one point per line
  - `--dim k`: compute persistent homology up to dimension *k*
  - `--threshold t`: compute Rips complexes up to diameter *t*
  - `--modulus p`: compute homology with coefficients in the prime field Z/*p*Z (only available when built with the option `USE_COEFFICIENTS`)




### Planned features

The following features are currently planned for future versions:

 - computation of representative cycles for persistent homology (currenly only *co*cycles are computed)
 - support for sparse distance matrices

Prototype implementations are already avaliable; please contact the author if one of these features might be relevant for your research.
